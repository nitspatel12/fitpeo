- I have build android app on below requirement

Write a android machine test with calling get API and populated all the data in recycler view, on tap detail activity open with header image, title and description .

Get API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos

1. MVVM design pattern
  * I have used MVVM architecture in this app. Used single activity architecture and created two fragment HomeFragment and DetailFragment.
2. Retrofit Client
3. Dagger 2 or similar library
  * I have used dagger2 for DI
4. Kotlin
5. Data binding and View binding
6. Use Picasso library for image rendering

Note: In above api there is no description field on it thats why have not added that view in DetailFragment
